As drones are growing rapidly in popularity, their use in multiple section is increasing exponentially. Over the past few years, drones have become central to the functions of various businesses and governmental organizations and have managed to pierce through areas where certain industries were either stagnant or lagging behind. From quick deliveries at rush hour to scanning an unreachable military base, drones are proving to be extremely beneficial in places where man cannot reach or is unable to perform in a timely and efficient manner.

Drone is not just a body with a battery with propellers; it works in a much complex way as it seem to be. There are many intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the flight of drone.

Applying and modeling full dynamics of drone is not a new idea and is not the focus of paper. Instead, contribution of this paper is a novel way to understand the core and basic dynamics of a quadrotor drone while replicating a defined trajectory in YZ plane. This way has enabled us to understand the very basic and important extrinsic and intrinsic factor affecting the drone flight.

## Setup and run:
1. Clone the simulink file attached below.
2. Open the downloaded `.slx` file in simulink and run.
3. Click of the scopes added to the model to visualize the trajectory with respect to time.
